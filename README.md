# Calculator with UI

This is a simple calculator program with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library in Python. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as calculate the square root of a number.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Clear button to reset the entry field
- Square root operation to calculate the square root of a number
- Error handling to display "Error" when an invalid expression is entered

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- VsCode

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `calculator.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `calculator.py` file is located.
4. Run the following command to start the calculator program:
    ```
    python calculator.py
    ```
5. The calculator window will appear.
6. Use the number buttons, operator buttons, and the clear button to input your desired calculation.
7. Click the equal button (=) to perform the calculation.
8. The result will be displayed in the entry field.

## Example

Let's say you want to calculate the square root of a number. Here's how you can do it using this calculator:

1. Run the program following the instructions in the "Usage" section.
2. Enter the number for which you want to find the square root.
3. Click the square root button (labelled "âˆš").
4. The result, which is the square root of the entered number, will be displayed in the entry field.

## Limitations

- The calculator program supports basic arithmetic operations and square root only. It does not handle complex mathematical expressions or advanced functions.
